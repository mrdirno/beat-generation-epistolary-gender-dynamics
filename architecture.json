  "cover_prompt": "A determined female archivist, her face etched with focus and quiet rebellion, carefully arranges a collection of cracked porcelain teacups on a worn wooden table, each cup holding a fragile, handwritten letter, while the translucent, ghostly silhouette of a famous male Beat poet looms imposingly behind her, trying to obscure her work. The scene is set in a cluttered, intimate 1950s apartment archive at night, shelves overflowing with manuscripts and stolen ephemera, a single desk lamp cutting through the spectral haze, revealing intimate epistolary fragments between two women scattered amongst the cups. Rendered in the atmospheric, textured, and emotionally charged style of painter Alice Neel, with the intimate documentary quality of photographer Nan Goldin. Book cover framing, centered composition with a tight, dramatic close-up that feels both vulnerable and confrontational, as if catching a private act of reclamation. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with a warm, sepia-toned color palette for the intimate foreground, contrasted against the cold, blue-grey haze of the looming male silhouette. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
